# Project 1

For Project 1, you'll use this project as a template to refactor and add additional functionalities of your choice.

## Setting Up
The recommended practice when working with project locally is to set up a virtual environment.

You should also have .env file containing environment variables specific to this project.

Refer to the notes from Week 2 Day 3 for instructions on both.

Once everything is done, you can install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the app, simply run `py app.py`

## Ideas for refactor and additional functionalities
- Refactor the application to multiple files 
- Expand to a main function + various other methods
- Load documents (ie text files, etc) as context, to simulate a RAG
- Add a text UI
- Change the prompt. Give the LLM different persona. (Customer Service bot? Ordering bot?)
